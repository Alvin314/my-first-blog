         <p style="font-size: 17px">Thanksgiving is America’s most beloved annual<br> holiday and takes place on the fourth <br>Thursday of November, kicking off the so-called Holiday Season.<br>

The origins of Thanksgiving date back to 1621 when a group of English<br> pilgrims in present-day Massachusetts shared a feast with a tribe of <br>Native Americans to celebrate a plentiful harvest.</p>

         <ph style="font-size: 17px">New Year’s Eve is a day of mixed feelings for many people.<br> On one hand, it is a time to celebrate the end of the year gone by and<br> welcome what is in store in the New Year. On the other hand, some people<br> experience a sense of nostalgia as they reflect on the events that took place in their lives in the past 12 months. Many people start thinking about New Year’s <br>resolutions at this time of the year.
Some people celebrate New Year’s Eve by attending midnight church services, while others gather around in <br>public venues such as Times Square in New York City, or Trafalgar Square in London to count down for the closing seconds of the old year. <br>Many people hold parties to farewell the finishing year and to celebrate the New Year. The size of festive events for <br>New Year’s Eve can vary in size and theme. Some people attend formal masquerade balls while others have costume parties.<br> Some people have small parties or gatherings at their homes. Many New Year’s Eve celebrations are highlighted by firework displays.</p>
